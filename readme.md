# Ct-OS

This is a little operating system that runs in your browser. You can visit it [here](www.ct-os.us).

## What does it do?

You start at a desktop. You can click "Ct" and get a list of the available programs, which presently includes a text editor and a web browser. You can hit "Save" and save your desktop state, so that when you come back to [ct-os.us](www.ct-os.us) you will have the same programs running.

## Where is this going?

No where I guess! There are some features I would like to add that I dont have time for at the moment. I would be cool to be able to save files onto your desktop. I would be cool to be able to open up any text file on the internet, and then upload it somewhere else. That would be a fun proof of concept. There is also the idea of externally loading in programs, but that would be hard and probably not worth much. Presently the drop down buttons dont do anything.
